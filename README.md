BUBBLE BURST:
Bubble Burst is a fun game in which bubbles appear at random places on the screen. The main aim of the player is to burst the bubbles before they fill up a major part of the screen.

RULES:
Burst the bubbles which appear on the screen by clicking on them.

Game ends when more than 75% of the screen is filled with bubbles.

Warning alarm will sound when the bubbles start piling up.

Thin bubbles require 1 click to pop, whereas rock (thick) bubbles require 5 clicks to pop.

Felix-Felicis (Liquid luck) can be used twice throughout the game to stop bubble generation for 5 seconds.

Thanos' infinity gauntlet clears half the bubbles on snap (click).

Tap the SPACEBAR to pause and tap it again to resume the game.

Score is inversely proportional to the size of the bubbles popped.

Once the game ends, press ENTER to restart the game.
